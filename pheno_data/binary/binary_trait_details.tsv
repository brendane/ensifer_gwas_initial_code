#Full list of “binary” traits. Unless otherwise noted, individual strains were inoculated onto TY plates
#amended with one of the substances, grown at 30°C for 48 hours, and the phenotype was assessed
#visually. In most cases, the phenotype was whether or not growth occurred, but other phenotypes
#(e.g. enzyme activity) were tested for some traits, as noted in the table below. All traits were tested
#with three replicates. “Enzyme activity” traits were measured following Cappuccino & Sherman
#(2014, Microbiology: A Laboratory Manual, 11th Edition, New York).
#The ability to grow in the presence of several flavonoids was assessed by inoculating bacteria onto
#TY plates that had been ammended with the flavonoid dissolved in the minimum amount of ethanol
